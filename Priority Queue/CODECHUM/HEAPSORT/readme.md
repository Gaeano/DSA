Heapsort is basically reversing the order

- minHeap -> originally its highest priority is the lowest (smallest to largest) with heapsort its going to be (largest to smallest)
- maxHeap -> originally its highest priority is the highest (largest to smallest) with heapsort its going be be (smallest to largest)
